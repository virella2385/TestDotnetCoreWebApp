This is still in progress. This project is just an example I'm making while learning dotnet core from Pluralsight using an empty web app project temple from the cli. Nevertheless, I hope anyone that sees this will find it helpful. To run, make sure to have the dotnet core runtime installed, after that in the cli type 'dotnet run'.
