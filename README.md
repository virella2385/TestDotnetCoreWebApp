This is still in progress. This project is just an example I'm making while learning dotnet core from Pluralsight using an empty web app project temple from the cli. Nevertheless, I hope anyone that sees this will find it helpful. To run, make sure to have the dotnet core runtime installed, after that in the cli type 'dotnet run'. Make sure to have access to SQL Server and a login with the dbcreator role assigned. For the connection string, edit the appsettings.json file.
